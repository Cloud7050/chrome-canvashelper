# Canvas Little Helper

Canvas Little Helper is a Chrome extension that aims to provide convenient bits of automation for Instructure's Canvas LMS.

It is available for [free on the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/canvas-little-helper/phlhcifpndofokoohbieihpifnfbiojn)!

It is currently in active development. As such, it only supports NUS's Canvas, but more should be coming soon. You are welcome to give it a try and tell me what you think over Discord @ Cloud#4535.

Features:

- Download Tracker: Highlight new files you've yet to download, or ones that've been modified since you last did
- Quiz Transferer: Easily transfer your quiz answers between attempts (still integrating, see [here](https://github.com/Cloud7050/js-canvastransfer) for the standalone easy-to-use script)

More detailed descriptions/instructions/limitations etc to come once more has been done
